          <div class="faq-question">
            Where's the best place for Dental surgery?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            The best place for dental surgery depends on your location, but in
            Chennai, many patients recommend clinics like Dr. Smilez or Apollo
            White Dental for their technology and expertise.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Can a tooth infection affect the eyes?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Yes, in rare cases, an upper tooth infection can spread to the
            sinuses and affect areas near the eyes, potentially leading to
            swelling or even vision issues. Always treat infections early.
          </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">
            Can dental infections cause other problems?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Absolutely. Untreated dental infections can lead to abscesses,
            jawbone damage, or spread to other parts of the body, potentially
            causing serious systemic health issues.
          </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">
            Are clear aligners as good as Invisalign?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            Clear aligners from other brands can be effective, but Invisalign is
            known for its advanced technology and results. However, quality
            varies, so always consult a certified orthodontist.

            What is the best dental clinic in Chennai?

            Top-rated dental clinics in Chennai include Dr. Smilez Dental
            Center, Apollo White Dental, and The Dental Studio. The best clinic
            for you depends on your specific needs and location.
